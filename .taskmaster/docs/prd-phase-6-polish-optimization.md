# Noka PRD - Phase 6: Polish & Optimization

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for Phase 6 of Noka. With the core features now in place, this phase is dedicated to refining the user experience (UX), improving application performance, and ensuring the UI is robust and professional. This is about transforming a functional app into a delightful one.

## 2. Vision & Goals
Our vision is to create an application that is not only powerful but also fast, reliable, and a pleasure to use.
**Key Goals for this Phase:**
- Enhance the user experience with comprehensive loading states, smooth transitions, and helpful empty states.
- Optimize front-end performance by implementing caching, prefetching, and code splitting.
- Ensure the application is fully responsive and accessible across all target devices.
- Implement robust error handling across the application.

## 3. Implementation Plan (Phase 6)
As per the main PRD, the focus for this phase is:

**User Experience:**
- Implement comprehensive loading states (e.g., skeletons).
- Add error boundaries and fallbacks for components.
- Create empty states with actionable prompts (e.g., "You have no accounts. Add one now!").
- Add micro-animations and transitions for a smoother feel.
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness on all screens.

**Performance:**
- Implement React Query (or similar, like SWR) for data caching and synchronization.
- Add optimistic updates for CRUD actions to improve perceived performance.
- Create data prefetching strategies (e.g., prefetch data on hover).
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports for heavy components or libraries.
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists like the transaction history.

## 4. Key Areas of Focus

### 4.1. Loading States
- **What**: Skeletons or spinners should appear whenever data is being fetched.
- **Where**: All lists (transactions, accounts, categories), dashboard numbers, and any component that relies on asynchronous data.

### 4.2. Error Handling
- **What**: Graceful error handling for both API errors and client-side exceptions.
- **Where**:
    - Wrap components in Error Boundaries to prevent a component crash from taking down the whole page.
    - Show user-friendly messages (e.g., using `sonner` or toasts) when an API call fails (e.g., "Failed to update category. Please try again.").

### 4.3. Empty States
- **What**: Instead of showing a blank screen, display a helpful message and a call-to-action.
- **Where**:
    - **Transactions screen**: "No transactions found for this period. Add your first one!"
    - **Accounts screen**: "No accounts yet. Let's add one."
    - **Dashboard**: "Start recording transactions to see your financial summary."

### 4.4. Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Use a library like React Query to cache server state. This avoids re-fetching data unnecessarily, making navigation feel instant.
- **Optimistic Updates**: For actions like creating, updating, or deleting an item, update the UI *before* the API call completes. If the call fails, roll back the change and show an error. This makes the app feel extremely responsive.
- **Code Splitting**: Heavy components or libraries (e.g., charting libraries, date pickers) should be loaded dynamically using `next/dynamic` so they don't impact the initial page load time.
- **Virtualization**: The transaction list could potentially grow very large. A virtualized list (using a library like `tanstack-virtual`) will only render the items currently in the viewport, ensuring high performance even with thousands of transactions.

### 4.5. Accessibility
- **What**: Ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Where**:
    - All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.
    - Images and icons should have `alt` text or `aria-label`s.
    - Use semantic HTML.
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast.
    - Test with screen readers.

## 5. Technical Considerations
- **Library Choices**:
    - **Data Fetching/Caching**: React Query is the recommended choice due to its powerful features like caching, optimistic updates, and automatic refetching.
    - **Animations**: `framer-motion` can be used for subtle, performant micro-animations.
    - **Virtualization**: `@tanstack/react-virtual` is a good, headless option.
- **Testing**:
    - Performance can be benchmarked using Lighthouse scores. Set a baseline score and aim to improve it.
    - Manually test for UX polish: click through the app quickly, simulate slow network conditions, and ensure the loading/error/empty states behave as expected.
    - Use accessibility testing tools like Axe to audit the application.
