		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Supabase Authentication Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase authentication setup into: package installation and configuration, environment variable setup, AuthProvider context creation, and session management implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving multiple configuration steps, environment setup, and React context implementation. Well-defined scope but requires coordination between multiple components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Protected Routes Middleware",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: ProtectedRoute component creation, redirect logic implementation, and loading state management for authentication checks.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity with clear authentication patterns. Depends on task 1 but has straightforward implementation once auth is established."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Landing Page with Authentication Entry Points",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: responsive layout and navigation creation, hero section and CTA implementation, and footer with legal links setup.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively straightforward frontend task with standard landing page components. Main complexity is ensuring responsive design and accessibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Authentication Forms (Sign Up, Sign In, Password Reset)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: form component creation, validation logic implementation, Supabase Auth integration, error handling and user feedback, and security measures (CSRF, sanitization).",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple forms, comprehensive validation, error handling, and security considerations. Critical user-facing functionality requiring robust implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create Database Schema and API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: database schema design and creation, authentication middleware setup, individual API endpoint implementation (settings, accounts, categories), input validation and sanitization, and comprehensive error handling.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving database design, multiple API endpoints, security validation, and proper error handling. Backend task requiring careful consideration of data integrity and security."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Multi-Step Onboarding Wizard Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: wizard component structure and navigation, state management implementation, step validation and persistence, and completion flow handling.",
			"reasoning": "Complex component requiring sophisticated state management, step validation, and persistence. Foundation for subsequent onboarding steps with multiple technical considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Onboarding Steps: Welcome, Currency & Financial Period Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: welcome step with currency selection, financial period configuration step, and form validation and progression logic.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity with specific form inputs and validation rules. Builds on wizard framework but has straightforward implementation requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Onboarding Steps: Account & Category Creation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: account creation form implementation, category creation with emoji picker, budget and target configuration logic, form validation and submission handling, and onboarding completion flow.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple form types, emoji picker integration, conditional budget/target logic, and critical completion handler that affects user flow. Requires integration with multiple backend endpoints."
