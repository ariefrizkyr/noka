Create user_settings table with specified schema including currency_code, financial_month_start_day, financial_week_start_day, and onboarding_completed fields. Implement POST /api/settings endpoint with user authentication validation and input sanitization. Create POST /api/accounts endpoint for account creation during onboarding. Implement POST /api/categories endpoint for category creation. Add proper error handling, validation, and CSRF protection to all endpoints. Ensure all endpoints validate Supabase session tokens.
