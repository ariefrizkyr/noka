# Task ID: 6
# Title: Build Multi-Step Onboarding Wizard Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the onboarding wizard component structure with step navigation and state management
# Details:
Implement multi-step wizard component with step navigation, progress indicator, and state management using Zustand or React Context. Create stepper UI with back/next navigation and step validation. Implement wizard state persistence to handle page refreshes. Add loading states and error handling for each step. Create completion handler that marks onboarding as complete and redirects to dashboard. Ensure wizard is mandatory for new users and skipped for returning users.

# Test Strategy:
Test step navigation and validation, verify state persistence across steps, test wizard completion flow, validate mandatory nature for new users, test error handling and recovery, verify redirect behavior

# Subtasks:
## 1. Wizard Component Structure and Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core wizard component with step-based navigation, including next/previous buttons, step indicators, and routing between wizard steps

## 3. Step Validation and Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement validation logic for each wizard step and data persistence mechanisms to save progress locally or remotely
### Details:
Create validation rules for each step, implement real-time validation feedback, and set up persistence layer to save wizard progress and allow users to resume later

## 4. Completion Flow Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
