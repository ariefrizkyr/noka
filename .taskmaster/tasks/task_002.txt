# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Protected Routes Middleware
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create route protection mechanism to secure authenticated areas of the application
# Details:
Create ProtectedRoute component that checks authentication status before rendering protected content. Implement redirect logic to send unauthenticated users to sign-in page. Add route guards for dashboard and onboarding pages. Handle loading states while checking authentication status. Implement automatic redirect after successful authentication to intended destination.

Test route protection by accessing protected routes without authentication, verify redirects work correctly, test authentication state changes and route updates, validate loading states during auth checks
