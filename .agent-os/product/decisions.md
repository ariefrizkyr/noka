## 2025-01-23: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Noka will focus on family-first financial management with collaborative features for shared accounts, joint budgeting, and transparent financial planning. The target market is families who need to coordinate finances together rather than individual users.

### Context

Personal finance applications typically focus on individual users, leaving families to manually coordinate across separate systems. Market research shows significant demand for collaborative financial management tools that provide transparency and shared decision-making capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Individual-focused finance app with sharing features**
   - Pros: Easier to build, established market patterns
   - Cons: Sharing would be an afterthought, poor user experience for families

2. **Business/enterprise financial management**
   - Pros: Proven collaborative patterns, complex feature set
   - Cons: Over-engineered for families, wrong user experience

### Rationale

Family financial management requires native multi-user functionality, not bolted-on sharing features. The collaborative aspect must be core to the product architecture and user experience from day one.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear differentiation from existing personal finance apps
- Strong product-market fit for underserved family market
- Natural expansion into related family financial services

**Negative:**
- More complex initial development than single-user app
- Requires careful permission and privacy management
- Higher technical complexity for real-time collaboration

## 2025-01-23: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Selected Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase, and shadcn/ui as the core technology stack for rapid development with enterprise-grade security and scalability.

### Context

Need to build a sophisticated financial application with real-time collaboration, robust security, and excellent user experience. The stack must support both rapid prototyping and long-term scalability.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **MEAN/MERN Stack**
   - Pros: Familiar, established patterns
   - Cons: More manual setup, less integrated security

2. **Ruby on Rails + React**
   - Pros: Rapid development, strong conventions
   - Cons: Deployment complexity, smaller talent pool

### Rationale

Next.js 15 with Supabase provides the best balance of development speed, built-in security features, and scalability. The App Router enables excellent user experience with server components, while Supabase handles authentication, database, and real-time features out of the box.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development with excellent developer experience
- Built-in security features reduce custom implementation
- Strong TypeScript support prevents runtime errors
- Vercel deployment provides excellent performance

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in with Supabase for backend services
- Bleeding-edge versions may have stability issues
- Less flexibility than custom backend implementation

## 2025-01-23: Security-First Development Approach

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Architect, Development Team

### Decision

Implement comprehensive security measures from the start, including CSRF protection, rate limiting, input sanitization, and secure session management, treating security as a core feature rather than an afterthought.

### Context

Financial applications handle sensitive personal and financial data, making security paramount. Rather than adding security later, we're building it into the foundation of the application architecture.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- User trust through demonstrable security measures
- Compliance readiness for financial regulations
- Reduced security vulnerabilities in production
- Strong foundation for enterprise features

**Negative:**
- Additional development complexity and time
- More thorough testing requirements
- Potential performance overhead from security measures
