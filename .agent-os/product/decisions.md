## 2025-08-03: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Noka will evolve from a personal finance tracker to a comprehensive personal and family finance management platform. The product will maintain existing personal finance functionality while adding family sharing capabilities with role-based permissions, joint account management, and member contribution tracking.

### Context

The personal finance market is saturated with individual-focused apps, but there's a gap in family financial collaboration tools. Current solutions either focus only on individuals or require separate family apps that don't integrate well with personal finance management. By extending Noka to support both personal and family use cases in a unified platform, we can differentiate in the market and provide unique value.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Separate Family App**
   - Pros: Clear separation of concerns, simpler architecture
   - Cons: User friction with multiple apps, data silos, maintenance overhead

2. **Individual-Only Focus**
   - Pros: Simpler product scope, faster development
   - Cons: Limited market differentiation, missed opportunity for family market

3. **Family-Only Pivot**
   - Pros: Clear market focus, unique positioning
   - Cons: Abandons existing individual users, smaller initial market

### Rationale

The unified approach leverages our existing strong personal finance foundation while expanding to the underserved family market. The family sharing requirements document shows a technically feasible path that maintains data isolation and security while providing seamless user experience.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Expanded target market including families
- Unique value proposition combining personal and family finance
- Higher user engagement through family collaboration
- Potential for viral growth through family invitations

**Negative:**
- Increased technical complexity with multi-tenant architecture
- Longer development timeline for family features
- More complex security and permission management
- Higher testing and QA requirements

## 2025-08-03: Family Sharing Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Engineering Team

### Decision

Implement family sharing using a multi-tenant architecture with strict data isolation between personal and family resources. Resources belong to either a user OR a family (never both), with family access managed through role-based permissions (Admin/Member).

### Context

Family sharing requires careful balance between collaboration and privacy. Users need to maintain control over personal finances while enabling family collaboration on shared resources. The architecture must ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Shared Resource Model**
   - Pros: Flexible resource sharing
   - Cons: Complex permissions, potential privacy violations

2. **Hierarchical Ownership**
   - Pros: Clear ownership chain
   - Cons: Overly complex, doesn't match user mental model

### Rationale

The chosen architecture provides clear ownership boundaries while enabling collaboration. The "Simple Ownership" principle ensures users understand what is personal vs. family, reducing confusion and security risks.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear data ownership and access patterns
- Strong security through Row Level Security policies
- Scales to multiple families per user
- Maintains existing personal functionality unchanged

**Negative:**
- Cannot easily convert personal resources to family resources
- Requires careful UI design to show resource context
- More complex database queries for unified views

## 2025-08-03: Settings and Onboarding Integration

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Designer

### Decision

Any new settings or configuration options added to the app/settings/ directory must also be integrated into the onboarding journey at app/onboarding/ to ensure new users have a complete setup experience.

### Context

The onboarding flow is critical for user activation and retention. Settings that are only accessible after onboarding may be missed by new users, leading to incomplete setup and poor initial experience.

### Rationale

Maintaining parity between settings and onboarding ensures all users, whether new or existing, have access to the same configuration options at the appropriate time in their journey.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent user experience for new and existing users
- Complete setup process for new users
- Higher user activation rates

**Negative:**
- Additional development work for each new setting
- Potential onboarding flow bloat if not managed carefully

## 2025-08-03: Code-First Development Approach

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Engineering Team, Tech Lead

### Decision

Adopt a code-first development approach for rapid feature delivery, with manual verification requirements for all changes. Automated testing is encouraged but not mandatory for delivery.

### Context

The project is in active development phase where speed of iteration is prioritized. While automated testing is valuable, the overhead of comprehensive test coverage may slow down feature delivery during this phase.

### Rationale

Manual verification ensures functionality works correctly while allowing faster development cycles. The team has strong code review practices that catch most issues before deployment.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster feature delivery and iteration
- Less overhead for experimental features
- Flexible development process

**Negative:**
- Higher risk of bugs in production
- More time spent on manual testing
- Potential for regression issues as codebase grows
