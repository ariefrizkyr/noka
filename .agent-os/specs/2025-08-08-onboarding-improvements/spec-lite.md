# Spec Summary (Lite)

Improve the onboarding user experience by streamlining the flow for invited users, simplifying family resource creation, adding inline editing capabilities, and enabling member invitations during family setup.

Key improvements include skipping preference selection for invited users, auto-connecting joint accounts/categories to the created family instead of requiring dropdown selection, adding inline editing for existing resources, and allowing family creators to invite members during the initial setup process. These changes will reduce friction while maintaining UI coherence.
