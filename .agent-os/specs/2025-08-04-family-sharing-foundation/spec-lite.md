# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement comprehensive family sharing functionality that transforms Noka from personal finance tracking to collaborative family financial management across 4 phases. Users can create families, invite members with role-based permissions (Admin/Member), manage joint accounts and shared categories, while maintaining strict data isolation between personal and family finances.

The implementation enables unified dashboard views showing both personal and family data with member contribution tracking, email-based invitation system, and zero-downtime database migrations. Core features include multi-tenant architecture with Row Level Security, family-aware APIs, and enhanced UI forms with scope selection for Personal/Joint accounts and Personal/Shared categories.
