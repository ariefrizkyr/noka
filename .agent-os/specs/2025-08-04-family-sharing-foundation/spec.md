# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Family Sharing Foundation
> Created: 2025-08-04

## Overview

Implement comprehensive family sharing functionality for Noka that transforms it from personal finance tracking to collaborative family financial management. This feature enables users to create families, invite members with role-based permissions, manage joint accounts and shared categories, while maintaining strict data isolation between personal and family finances. The implementation focuses on minimal UI changes with targeted enhancements to onboarding, settings, and existing forms, ensuring a seamless integration that preserves the existing user experience while adding powerful collaboration capabilities.

## User Stories

### Family Administrator Story

As a family financial administrator, I want to create a family and invite my spouse and children as members, so that we can collaboratively manage our household finances while maintaining individual control over personal accounts and shared visibility into joint expenses and family budgets.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Create family from settings page with descriptive name
2. Invite family members via email with appropriate roles (Admin/Member)
3. Create joint bank accounts and shared expense categories visible to all family members
4. Set family-wide budgets and investment targets with member contribution tracking
5. View unified dashboard showing both personal and family financial progress
6. Monitor individual member contributions to shared goals for transparency

### Family Member Story

As a family member, I want to accept family invitations and contribute to shared financial goals, so that I can participate in household financial management while keeping my personal finances separate and understanding my contribution to family budgets.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Receive and accept family invitation via email
2. Access both personal and family accounts/categories in unified interface
3. Log transactions against joint accounts and shared categories
4. View family financial progress with my individual contributions highlighted
5. Maintain personal account privacy while contributing to family transparency

### New User Onboarding Story

As a new user signing up for Noka, I want to choose whether to use it for personal or family finance management during onboarding, so that my initial setup experience is tailored to my intended use case from the start.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. During onboarding, choose between "Personal" or "Family" finance management
2. If choosing "Personal", follow existing onboarding flow unchanged
3. If choosing "Family", first create family setup, then proceed with account/category creation with family context
4. Account and category setup automatically includes scope selection based on chosen approach
