      "taskTitle": "Implement 'Continue with Google' Button UI",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a UI component with specific styling requirements following Google's branding guidelines. The complexity is moderate because the requirements are well-defined, the code sample is provided, and it's a self-contained component. The main challenges are ensuring exact compliance with Google's guidelines and proper accessibility implementation.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Continue with Google' Button UI implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Component setup and basic structure, 2) Styling implementation according to Google guidelines, and 3) Accessibility and responsive behavior testing."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Client-Side Google SSO Logic",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward as it involves implementing a single function that calls Supabase's OAuth API. The code example is provided, and the implementation is concise. The main considerations are error handling and state management during the authentication flow.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Client-Side Google SSO Logic implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic OAuth flow implementation with Supabase client, and 2) Error handling and loading state management."

      "taskTitle": "Create Next.js Route Handler for Auth Callback",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a server-side route handler to process OAuth callbacks. The implementation is straightforward with clear requirements and provided code. The complexity is low to moderate as it requires understanding of Next.js route handlers and Supabase authentication flow.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the Next.js Route Handler for Auth Callback implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic route handler implementation with code exchange, and 2) Error handling and redirection logic."

      "taskTitle": "Update Next.js Middleware for Auth Routes",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "reasoning": "This task involves configuring middleware for session management, which requires understanding of Next.js middleware, cookie handling, and Supabase authentication. The complexity is moderate because it affects the entire application's authentication flow and requires careful implementation to avoid breaking existing functionality.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Next.js Middleware implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic middleware setup with Supabase client, 2) Cookie handling and session refresh logic, and 3) Route matcher configuration and testing."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Session Management and Redirection",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing session management across multiple routes and components. It requires coordination between client and server components, handling redirections based on authentication state, and implementing logout functionality. The complexity is moderate to high due to the distributed nature of the implementation across the application.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Session Management and Redirection implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Dashboard route protection, 2) Session verification in server components, 3) Logout functionality implementation, and 4) Redirection logic for authenticated and unauthenticated users."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Loading States for SSO Flow",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing comprehensive error handling and loading states across the SSO flow. It requires coordination between client-side components and server-side routes, creating error pages, and ensuring a smooth user experience. The complexity is moderate due to the need to handle various error scenarios and provide appropriate feedback.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Error Handling and Loading States implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Client-side loading and error states in the login component, 2) Error page creation for authentication failures, and 3) Integration of error handling in the callback route."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating the previously implemented Google SSO button into existing login and registration pages. The complexity is moderate as it requires working with existing components, ensuring proper positioning and styling, and maintaining the functionality of existing authentication flows.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Google SSO Button integration into subtasks covering: 1) Login page integration, 2) Registration page integration, and 3) UI/UX improvements including responsive design and visual separation from other authentication methods."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "reasoning": "This task involves comprehensive testing across multiple scenarios and updating documentation. The complexity is high due to the need to test various user flows, edge cases, and potential integration issues. It also requires coordination with other team members and updating multiple documentation sources.",
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the End-to-End Testing and Documentation Update into subtasks covering: 1) New user registration testing, 2) Existing user login testing, 3) Error flow testing, 4) Cross-browser and responsive testing, and 5) Documentation updates for developers and end-users."
