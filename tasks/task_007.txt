# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Session Management and Redirection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure that after successful OAuth callback and session exchange, the user session is correctly established, and the user is redirected to the dashboard or intended page. Protect routes based on session.
# Details:
1. The `/auth/callback` route (Task 5) redirects to `/dashboard` on success. 2. Protect dashboard/app routes by checking for user session. In Server Components:
```typescript
// app/dashboard/page.tsx (example)
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const supabase = createClient();
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) { redirect('/login'); }
  return <div>Welcome, {user.email}!</div>;
}
```
3. Implement a logout button that calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` and redirects to login.

# Test Strategy:
Log in via Google, verify redirection to dashboard. Access protected routes directly without login; verify redirection to login. Test logout functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Dashboard Route Protection [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure that the dashboard route is accessible only to authenticated users by checking the user's session state before rendering the dashboard component.
### Details:
Add middleware or route guards to the dashboard route. If the session is invalid or missing, redirect the user to the login page or an appropriate error page.

## 2. Session Verification in Server Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Verify the user's session in server-side components to prevent unauthorized access and ensure secure handling of user data.
### Details:
Implement logic in server-rendered components to check for a valid session token or cookie. If the session is invalid, trigger a redirect or return an error response.

## 3. Implement Logout Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Provide a secure logout mechanism that invalidates the user's session and removes any session tokens or cookies.
### Details:
Add a logout endpoint or handler that clears the session on the server and removes session identifiers from the client. Redirect the user to the login or home page after logout.

## 4. Implement Redirection Logic for Authenticated and Unauthenticated Users [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Set up redirection rules to guide users based on their authentication state, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.
### Details:
Configure logic to redirect authenticated users away from login/signup pages to the dashboard, and unauthenticated users away from protected routes to the login page.
