# Task ID: 10
# Title: End-to-End Testing and Documentation Update
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing for new user registration and existing user login via Google SSO. Update relevant user documentation.
# Details:
Test Scenarios:
1. New User Registration: Click Google button, authenticate with Google, verify new account in Supabase `auth.users`, land on dashboard.
2. Existing User Login (Google): Click Google button, authenticate, log into existing Supabase account, land on dashboard.
3. Existing User Login (email/password user with same email as Google): Test Supabase's behavior for account linking (should ideally log in or link). If not, document behavior.
4. Error flows: User cancels Google auth, invalid callback.
5. Test on multiple browsers and mobile viewport.
Documentation:
1. Update internal dev docs on OAuth setup. 2. Update user-facing FAQs/guides on using Google Sign-In. 3. Update onboarding flows if they detail sign-up methods.

# Test Strategy:
Execute all defined test scenarios systematically. Review and update all relevant documentation. Perform a user acceptance test (UAT) if possible.
