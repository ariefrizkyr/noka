# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Loading States for SSO Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Provide clear visual feedback during the SSO process, including loading indicators on the button and handling errors from `signInWithOAuth` or the callback.
# Details:
1. In client-side `handleGoogleSignIn` (Task 4), use `isLoading` state to disable button and show loading text. Display errors from `signInWithOAuth` to the user. 2. Create `app/auth/auth-code-error/page.tsx` for callback errors:
```tsx
// app/auth/auth-code-error/page.tsx
export default function AuthErrorPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Authentication Error</h1>
      <p>Sorry, we couldn't sign you in. Please try again or return to the login page.</p>
      <a href="/login">Go to Login</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```
3. Ensure the callback route (Task 5) redirects to this page on error.

# Test Strategy:
Test scenarios: user cancels Google login, network error during OAuth. Verify loading state on button click. Verify redirection to `auth-code-error` page if callback fails. Ensure error messages are user-friendly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Client-side Loading and Error States [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create loading indicators and error handling mechanisms in the login component to provide visual feedback during SSO authentication attempts.
### Details:
Add loading spinners during authentication requests, implement error message displays for failed login attempts, handle timeout scenarios, and ensure proper state management during the authentication flow. Follow SSO best practices by implementing real-time feedback for users when authentication is in progress or fails.

## 2. Create Authentication Error Pages [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Design and implement dedicated error pages that provide clear information and recovery options when SSO authentication fails.
### Details:
Develop user-friendly error pages with clear messaging for different authentication failure scenarios (invalid credentials, expired sessions, server errors, etc.). Include troubleshooting guidance, support contact information, and options to retry authentication or use alternative login methods. Ensure pages follow brand guidelines and provide a consistent user experience.

## 3. Integrate Error Handling in Callback Route [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling in the SSO callback route to properly manage and respond to authentication failures from identity providers.
### Details:
Add try-catch blocks in the callback route to capture authentication errors, implement proper error logging for debugging purposes, create error code mapping between SSO provider errors and application error messages, and ensure secure error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information. Redirect users to appropriate error pages based on the type of authentication failure.
